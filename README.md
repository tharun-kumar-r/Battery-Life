# Battery Life Application

A simple yet useful Windows application that provides voice notifications when your battery is low and needs charging, and when your battery is nearly full. This open-source project is designed to make battery management easy and efficient, especially for users who need audible alerts.

## Features

- **Voice Notifications**: Alerts you when your battery is low and needs charging.
- **Full Charge Notification**: Notifies you when your battery is almost fully charged, prompting you to unplug the charger.
- **Simple Installation**: Set up in a few easy steps.
- **Open Source**: Free for anyone to download, modify, and improve.

## Installation Process

Follow these simple steps to set up the Battery Life Application:

1. **Add the Application to Startup**:
   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `shell:startup` and press Enter.
   - Copy and paste the `Battery_Life.exe` file from `Application` Folder into the startup folder.

2. **Set Up Sound Notifications**:
   - Copy the `wav` folder from Wav_files folder containing the sound files.
   - Paste the folder into the root of the `C:\` drive (i.e., `C:\wav`).

3. **Restart Your Computer**:
   - After completing the setup, restart your computer to ensure the application starts automatically and functions properly.

## How It Works

Once installed, the application will automatically run at startup and monitor your battery status. When the battery level drops below a certain threshold, you will hear a voice notification prompting you to plug in the charger. Similarly, when your battery is almost fully charged, you'll receive an audio alert letting you know it's time to unplug the charger.
